:start;Getting started

   The ZZT Editor is a tool for
creating silly ZZT game worlds.

   By using the editor, you can create
individual game boards and then link them
together into a larger entity called a
"world".

   The editor functions the same as many
drawing programs:  Starting with a blank
screen, objects are added and arranged
until an interesting picture emerges.
Once a board has been created, it can be
saved to disk and then played, just like
a ready-made game.

   The editor is somewhat complex, so it
takes time to master.  Begin by creating
a few simple boards, then work you way
up to more complex scenarios at your own
pace.  The results will be well worth the
effort.


:cmds;Editor commands

[L]  Load a world from disk.
[S]  Save a world to disk.
[Q]  Quit the ZZT Editor.
[B]  Switch boards.  Also use this command
     to create a new board.
[I]  Board Information:  Change the
     characteristics of the particular
     board being edited.
!-info;More about Board Information.
[f1] Place an item on the board.
[f2] Place a creature on the board.
[f3] Place terrain on the board.
[f4] Enter text onto the board.  Use this
     to spruce up your boards with
     entertaining messages.  During
     gameplay, text acts like walls.
[Space] Place the selected pattern on the
     board.  The pattern is indicated on
     the bottom right of the screen.
[Tab] Toggle drawing mode.  When drawing
     mode is on, the current pattern will
     automatically be placed wherever the
     cursor is moved.
[P]  Select pattern. Hold Shift to move
     backwards.
[C]  Select foreground color.
[Shift+C] Select background color.

   Some useful commands are not listed on
the screen.  These are:

[0-9] Pick a memorized pattern slot,
     from the first to the tenth.
[Z]  Clear board.
[X]  Fill in bounded region with
     current pattern - just draw the
     outline of a shape and use this
     command to fill it in.
[Delete] Remove the pattern on top
     of the cursor.
[D]  Disable ZZT's default coloring
     rules. This allows you to use
     non-standard colors for certain
     objects which don't allow it
     otherwise.
[Enter] Modify object under cursor:
     Allows you to change the
     properties of an object that
     has already been placed. It also
     copies the object to the pattern
     list, allowing it to be re-used.
[N]  New: Create a new world.
[T]  Transfer:  Import or Export boards.
     Allows individual boards to be
     brought in or out of worlds.
     A board from one world can be
     written to a file, then read back
     into a different world.
[f5] Place advanced elements on the
     board.
