$Advanced Elements

Advanced elements are not available in
the traditional ZZT editor. They exist
only as a result of certain artifacts
in the engine's behaviour. In essence,
they're like glitches - ones which the
ZZT community at large has learned to
rely on.

ZZT normally populates its board with a
border of "board edge" elements. As such,
these - when touched - act the same way
as if when crossing a board boundary.
